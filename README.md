# HearMe AI - The Versatile Meeting Summarization Tool

**HearMe AI** currently a web-based prototype that enables users to efficiently record or upload audio, which is then transcribed and summarized. Built using **Next.js**, it leverages **Deepgram's API** for real-time transcription and **Hugging Face** for generating detailed summaries. The app is designed to streamline meeting reviews by providing concise summaries of discussions.

## Features

- **Audio Recording & Uploading**: Users can record audio directly from the web app or upload pre-recorded files.
- **Automated Summarization**: Transcriptions and summaries are generated automatically using cutting-edge AI.
- **Email Summaries**: Summaries are emailed to users for easy reference.
- **Built with Next.js**: A fast, scalable framework for building the web app prototype.
- **Powered by Deepgram & Hugging Face**: For advanced speech-to-text and summarization capabilities.

## Prototype Overview

HearMe AI began as a final project aimed at revolutionizing how people revisit meetings. The prototype has garnered significant interest, with **150+ signups** and **400+ waitlist viewers** globally, marking the beginning of its journey.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hearme-ai.git
   cd hearme-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key
   ```

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Development

- Full integration of advanced summarization features.
- Expansion to support a wider range of file types and languages.
- Official launch after prototype refinements.
- Launch of a windows app
- An android and ios app
